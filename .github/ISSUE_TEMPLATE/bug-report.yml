        ## Investigation Hints for Copilot

        **Common Bug Areas**:
        - **Authentication**: Check `src/backend/routers/auth.py` and login flow in `src/static/app.js`
        - **Activity Registration**: Check `src/backend/routers/activities.py` endpoints and frontend API calls
        - **Database Issues**: Check `src/backend/database.py` for data consistency
        - **UI Issues**: Check `src/static/app.js` for JavaScript errors and `src/static/styles.css` for styling

        **Debugging Steps**:
        1. Reproduce the bug following the provided steps
        2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
        3. Verify API endpoints are working correctly (test at `/docs`)
        4. Check database state and data consistency
        5. Test fix across different browsers and user scenarios

        **Key Files to Check**:
        - `src/static/app.js`: Frontend logic and API calls
        - `src/backend/routers/activities.py`: Activity management endpoints
        - `src/backend/routers/auth.py`: Authentication logic
        - `src/backend/database.py`: Data storage and retrieval
        - `src/static/index.html`: DOM structure and elements

        **Testing Verification**:
        - Test the fix with the exact steps provided
        - Verify no regression in other areas
        - Check both teacher and student user flows
        - Test on multiple browsers if UI-related
