        ## Implementation Hints for Copilot

        **Database Location**: Activity data is stored in `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary.

        **File Structure**:
        - Add new activity entry to `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Follow existing format with required fields: `description`, `schedule`, `schedule_details`, `max_participants`, `participants`
        - The `schedule_details` object should contain `days` (array), `start_time`, and `end_time`

        **Testing**: After implementation, verify:
        - Activity appears on main page
        - Schedule displays correctly in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats
        - Registration and capacity tracking works properly

        **Constraints**:
        - Activity names must be unique
        - Times must be in HH:MM format (24-hour)
        - Days must match existing format: ["Monday", "Tuesday", etc.]
        - Participant emails should follow @mergington.edu format
