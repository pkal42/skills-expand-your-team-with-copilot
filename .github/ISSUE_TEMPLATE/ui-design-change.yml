        ## Implementation Hints for Copilot

        **CSS Location**: Styles are located in `src/static/styles.css`

        **Key CSS Classes/Areas**:
        - `.activity-card`: Individual activity cards
        - `.activity-tag`: Activity type tags
        - `.sidebar-filters`: Search and filter sidebar
        - `.modal`: Registration and login modals
        - `header`: Main page header
        - `.register-button`: Action buttons
        - CSS variables for colors are defined at the top of the file

        **Responsive Design**: 
        - Check existing media queries for mobile compatibility
        - Ensure changes work across different screen sizes
        - Test on both desktop and mobile layouts

        **Color System**:
        - Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent colors
        - Primary colors: `--primary`, `--primary-light`
        - Text colors: `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`
        - Background colors: `--background`, `--surface`

        **Testing Checklist**:
        - Verify changes appear correctly on desktop and mobile
        - Ensure all text remains readable
        - Check that functionality still works (buttons, forms, etc.)
        - Validate accessibility (contrast ratios, focus states)

        **Constraints**:
        - Don't break existing functionality
        - Maintain responsive design
        - Keep accessibility standards
        - Preserve existing CSS structure where possible
